          <h2 id="initial-concept">Initial Concept</h2>

          <p>
          The prompt for this project was to create a humanoid creature. I had to sculpt, texture, rig and then animate its walk. 
          </p>

          <h2 id="first-stage">First Stage</h2>

          <div className=" w-full h-auto  items-center flex justify-center rounded-sm">
            <Image
              className=" object-cover"
              src="/test.png"
              width={700}
              height={400}
              alt="Picture of the author"
              id="image"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
          Brainstorming ideas for the creature. I played around with different possible creatures that could exist. I came up with 3 different concepts, one duck/man, a book character and the wire character. The main reasons I rejected the other two ideas was because the duck character seemed a bit overdone and the book character wouldnâ€™t walk necessarily in a human way. 
          </p>
          

          <h2 id="second-stage">Second Stage</h2>
          <div className=" w-full h-auto bg-gray-200 items-center flex justify-center rounded-sm">
            <Image
              className=" object-cover"
              src="/refined.png"
              width={700}
              height={400}
              alt="Picture of the author"
              id="image"
            />
          </div>

          <p>
           In the second stage, we had to refine the character. I chose the wire character because it was the most interesting and the most challenging. I had to make sure that the character was humanoid enough to walk like a human. By this stage, I was starting to get a feel for the textures and colours I would want to use. Although later on I would move to a more green palette, the idea of wires being a key feature of the character was already fleshed out.
